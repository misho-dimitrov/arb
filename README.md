# TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY OF MORPHOMETRIC MRI MEASURES

## An R script to automatically calculate test-retest reliability (using two-way mixed model intra-class correlation coefficients with absolute agreement of single measurements (McGraw & Wong, 1996))


### Used for the reliability analysis in:
