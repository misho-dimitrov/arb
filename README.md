# VARIABILITY AND TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY OF MORPHOMETRIC MRI MEASURES

## ICC_EH_BRCnew.R - An R script to automatically calculate test-retest reliability (using two-way mixed model intra-class correlation coefficients with absolute agreement of single measurements (McGraw & Wong, 1996))

## mrd_mcv.R - An R script to automatically calculate mean relative difference and mean coefficient of variation (McGuire et al., 2017)


### Used for the variability and reliability analyses in:

*Reliability of MRI-derived brain estimates: The effects of scan session, head tilt, inter-scan interval, acquisition sequence, FreeSurfer version and processing stream*
