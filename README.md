# VARIABILITY AND TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY OF MORPHOMETRIC MRI MEASURES

## Programming scripts used for the analyses:<br>
**ICC_EH_BRCnew.R** - An R script to automatically calculate test-retest reliability (using two-way mixed model intra-class correlation coefficients with absolute agreement of single measurements (McGraw & Wong, 1996))<br>
**mrd_mcv.R** - An R script to automatically calculate mean relative difference and mean coefficient of variation (McGuire et al., 2017)

## Dataset:<br>
The Precision in Neuroimaging (PIN) study dataset, which includes MRI scans of the brain from individuals scanned at multiple time points and on different scanners - \url{https://sites.google.com/view/pinstudy}


## Used for the variability and reliability analyses in:

*Reliability of MRI-derived brain estimates: The effects of scan session, head tilt, inter-scan interval, acquisition sequence, FreeSurfer version and processing stream*
